      </h3>
      <p class="karma-medium">
        <strong> What it is: </strong> As housing and homelessness is a recurring issue in all cities, we decided to try to take the problem to Philadelphia and scale it to the rest of the country using pre-approved and affordable blueprints and materials to spread the growing idea of tiny housing to the world.

          <p style="text-align: center;">Nearly 1 in 3 Americans have stayed in an alternative living space rental and 92% enjoyed the stay.<p><br>

          <p style="text-align: center;">More than 1 in 10 (11%) Americans plan to buy an alternative living space in the next year<p><br>

          <p style="text-align: center;">According to a survey conducted by the National Association of Home Builders, 56% of adults in the US would consider living in a home that is less than 600 square feet.</p><br>

          <p style="text-align: center;">A study by the American Tiny House Association found that nearly half (46%) of Americans who are interested in tiny homes live in suburban areas, while only 30% live in urban areas.</p><br>
